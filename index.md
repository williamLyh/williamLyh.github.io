## Bio
Iâ€™m a second year PhD student with Prof. Nigel Collier in Language Technology Lab, University of Cambridge. My research focus is in AI and NLP, especially in Controlled Text Generation with Large Language Models. The goal of my PhD is to generate structurally coherent text in various domains, including News, dialogs, stories and recipes.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
